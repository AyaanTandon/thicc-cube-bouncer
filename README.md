# thicc-cube-bouncer
This is my first OpenGL and C++ project. 

## How to compile
Run this in terminal (should work on MacOSX, not sure about others)

`clang++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o bouncer -framework GLUT -framework OpenGL`

or just type `./main.sh` and it will compile and run.

## What it does
It is basically just a lot of bouncing. There is a stretched cube that bounces of the corners and also the window bounces back and forth. The cube also gets bigger and smaller depending on its position.
